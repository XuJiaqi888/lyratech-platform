## Platform Naming Story

LyraTech's name originates from the constellation Lyra, which contains Vega - one of the brightest stars in the night sky. In ancient mythology, Lyra represents Orpheus's harp, whose melodies could move mountains, fill seas, and calm storms.

**Just as Vega was once the North Star and will become the North Star again in the future, LyraTech believes that women's leadership positions in the tech field will continuously rotate and shine. We are committed to being the guiding star for women's tech career navigation, allowing every woman to shine brightly in the tech galaxy.**
